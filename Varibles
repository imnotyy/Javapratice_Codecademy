Output:
This morning Addie woke up feeling great. 'It is going to be a lovely day!' Outside, a bunch of cats were protesting to keep human in stores. They began to meow to the rhythm of the shell, which made all the kales very green. Concerned, Addie texted Lilia, who flew Addie to park and dropped Addie in a puddle of frozen orange juice. Addie woke up in the year 4, in a world where birds ruled the world.
